//! Konfig V0 — K8s ConfigMap watcher with FlatBuffers-encoded trading config.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - [`types`] — owned Rust snapshot structs (no FlatBuffers borrows)
//! - [`cache`] — `ArcSwap`-backed lock-free cache for the current config
//! - [`codec`] — FlatBuffers tonic codec (promoted from Phase 0 spike)
//! - [`watcher`] — kube-rs ConfigMap watcher that drives cache updates
